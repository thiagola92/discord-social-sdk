# Discord Social SDK
Wrapper around [Discord Social SDK](https://discord.com/developers/docs/discord-social-sdk/overview).  

Is suppose to be a close one-to-one with the C++ SDK, so looking at the [official C++ documentation](https://discord.com/developers/docs/discord-social-sdk/getting-started/using-c++) is recommended to understand how the SDK works.  

# Usage

I will include some examples but I don't intend to replicate the C++ documentation, you should be able to translate after reading some examples.  

## Examples

**GDScript**  
```gdscript
# Replace with your Discord Application ID
const APPLICATION_ID = 123456789012345678

var client: DiscordppClient = DiscordppClient.new()

func _ready() -> void:
    print("ðŸš€ Initializing Discord SDK...")

    client.AddLogCallback(
        func(message, severity):
            print("[%s] %s" % [Discordpp.EnumToString18(severity), message]),
        DiscordppLoggingSeverity.Info
    )


func _process(delta: float) -> void:
    Discordpp.RunCallbacks()
```

> Why function `Discordpp.EnumToString18()` has a weird name?  

Godot doesn't support [function overloading](https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/cpp_function_overloading.asp), so I just made one function for each option.  

# Development
This GDExtension is **all** built using Python and **nothing** should be add manually at `src`. If this is weird for you, listen to me...  

All that I want is to use the SDK from GDScript, without assuming any setup from the user, which means that I can guess all the logic behind the methods wrappers:  

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    gd_to_c[gdscript types to c types]
    return_void{return void?}
    call_method1["method(args)"]
    call_method2["auto r = method(args)"]
    c_to_gd[c type to gdscript type]

    gd_to_c-->return_void
    return_void--"yes"-->call_method1
    return_void--"no"-->call_method2
    call_method2-->c_to_gd
```

Knowing this I automated generating all the GDExtension source code through Python code, which is a language that I prefer to user when I don't have to care about low level/security/speed/anything.  

Now that you understand why everything is done through Python, let me explain what is done through Python:  
- Clean headers
- Parse headers
- Build source code

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Clean --> Parse
    Parse --> Build
```

**Clean**: Remove unnecessary informations from headers. We are not a C/C++ compiler, so we don't need many lines from the headers and this makes our parser job easier.  

**Parse**: Scan headers to collect useful informations for us. This is closer to be a tokenizer + parser but built together because this is much easier than a scanning a complete programming language.  

**Build**: Build our GDExtension source code (writing `.cpp` and `.h` files in `src/`).
