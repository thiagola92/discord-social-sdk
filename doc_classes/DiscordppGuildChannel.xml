		<method name="IsViewableAndWriteableByAllMembers">
			<return type="bool" />
			<description>
 Whether the channel is "fully public" which means every member of the guild is able to view and send messages in that channel.
 Discord allows lobbies to be linked to private channels in a server, which enables things like a private admin chat.
 However there is no permission synchronization between the game and Discord, so it is the responsibility of the game to restrict access to the lobby. Every member of the lobby will be able to view and send messages in the lobby/channel, regardless of whether that user would have permission to do so in Discord.
 This may be more complexity than a game wants to take on, so instead you can only allow linking of channels that are fully public in the server so there is no confusion.
