	<brief_description>
	All messages sent on Discord are done so in a Channel. [method DiscordMessageHandle.channel_id] will contain the ID of the channel a message was sent in, and [method DiscordClient.get_channel_handle] will return an instance of this class.

	<description>
	Handle objects in the SDK hold a reference both to the underlying data, and to the SDK instance. Changes to the underlying data will generally be available on existing handles objects without having to re-create them. If the SDK instance is destroyed, but you still have a reference to a handle object, note that it will return the default value for all method calls (ie an empty string for methods that return a string).
