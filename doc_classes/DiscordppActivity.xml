 An Activity represents one "thing" a user is doing on Discord and is part of their rich presence.
 Additional information is located on the Discord Developer Portal: [br]- https://discord.com/developers/docs/rich-presence/overview [br]- https://discord.com/developers/docs/developer-tools/game-sdk#activities [br]- https://discord.com/developers/docs/rich-presence/best-practices
 While RichPresence supports multiple types of activities, the only activity type that is really relevant for the SDK is ActivityTypes::Playing. Additionally, the SDK will only expose Activities that are associated with the current game (or application). So for example, a field like `name` below, will always be set to the current game's name from the view of the SDK.

 [b]## Customization[/b]
 When an activity shows up on Discord, it will look something like this: [br]1. Playing "game name" [br]2. Capture the flag | 2 - 1 [br]3. In a group (2 of 3)
 You can control how lines 2 and 3 are rendered in Discord, here's the breakdown: [br]- Line 1, `Playing "game name"` is powered by the name of your game (or application) on Discord. [br]- Line 2, `Capture the flag | 2 - 1` is powered by the `details` field in the activity, and this should generally try to describe what the _player_ is currently doing. You can even include dynamic data such as a match score here. [br]- Line 3, `In a group (2 of 3)` describes the _party_ the player is in. "Party" is used to refer to a group of players in a shared context, such as a lobby, server, team, etc. The first half, `In a group` is powered by the `state` field in the activity, and the second half, `(2 of 3)` is powered by the `party` field in the activity and describes how many people are in the current party and how big the party can get.
 This diagram visually shows the field mapping:

 [url]https://discord.com/developers/docs/social-sdk/rich_presence.png[/url]
 You can also specify up to two custom buttons to display on the rich presence. These buttons will open the URL in the user's default browser.

 [color=orange]WARNING:[/color] The following example is in C++.
 [codeblock lang=text]
     discordpp::ActivityButton button;
     button.SetLabel("Button 1");
     button.SetUrl("https://example.com");
     activity.AddButton(button);
 [/codeblock]


 [b]## Invites / Joinable Activities[/b]
 Other users can be invited to join the current player's activity (or request to join it too), but that does require certain fields to be set: [br]1. ActivityParty must be set and have a non-empty ActivityParty::Id field. All users in the party should set the same id field too! [br]2. ActivityParty must specify the size of the group, and there must be room in the group for another person to join. [br]3. ActivitySecrets::Join must be set to a non-empty string. The join secret is only shared with users who are accepted into the party by an existing member, so it is truly a secret. You can use this so that when the user is accepted your game knows how to join them to the party. For example it could be an internal game ID, or a Discord lobby ID/secret that the client could join.
 There is additional information about game invites here: https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001557452-Game-Invites

 [b]### Mobile Invites[/b]
 Activity invites are handled via a deep link. To enable users to join your game via an invite in the Discord client, you must do two things: [br]1. Set your deep link URL in the Discord developer portal. This will be available on the General tab of your application once Social Layer integration is enabled for your app. [br]2. Set the desired supported platforms when reporting the activity info in your rich presence, e.g.:


 [color=orange]WARNING:[/color] The following example is in C++.
 [codeblock lang=text]
     activity.SetSupportedPlatforms(
         ActivityGamePlatforms.Desktop |
         ActivityGamePlatforms.IOS |
         ActivityGamePlatforms.Android);
 [/codeblock]

 When the user accepts the invite, the Discord client will open: `[your url]/_discord/join?secret=[the join secret you set]`

 [b]### Example Invites Flow[/b]
 If you are using Discord lobbies for your game, a neat flow would look like this: [br]- When a user starts playing the game, they create a lobby with a random secret string, using Client::CreateOrJoinLobby [br]- That user publishes their RichPresence with the join secret set to the lobby secret, along with party size information [br]- Another use can then see that RichPresence on Discord and join off of it [br]- Once accepted the new user receives the join secret and their client can call CreateOrJoinLobby(joinSecret) to join the lobby [br]- Finally the original user can notice that the lobby membership has changed and so they publish a new RichPresence update containing the updating party size information.

 [b]### Invites Code Example[/b]


 [color=orange]WARNING:[/color] The following example is in C++.
 [codeblock lang=text]
 // User A
 // 1. Create a lobby with secret
 std::string lobbySecret = "foo";
 client-&gt;CreateOrJoinLobby(lobbySecret, [=](discordpp::ClientResult result, uint64_t lobbyId) {
     // 2. Update rich presence with join secret
     discordpp::Activity activity{};
     // set name, state, party size ...
     discordpp::ActivitySecrets secrets{};
     secrets.SetJoin(lobbySecret);
     activity.SetSecrets(secrets);
     client-&gt;UpdateRichPresence(std::move(activity), [](discordpp::ClientResult result) {});
 });
 // 3. Some time later, send an invite
 client-&gt;SendActivityInvite(USER_B_ID, "come play with me", [](auto result) {});


 // User B
 // 4. Monitor for new invites. Alternatively, you can use
 // Client::SetActivityInviteUpdatedCallback to get updates on existing invites.
 client-&gt;SetActivityInviteCreatedCallback([client](auto invite) {
     // 5. When an invite is received, ask the user if they want to accept it.
     // If they choose to do so then go ahead and invoke AcceptActivityInvite
     client-&gt;AcceptActivityInvite(invite,
         [client](discordpp::ClientResult result, std::string secret) {
         if (result.Successful()) {
             // 5. Join the lobby using the joinSecret
             client-&gt;CreateOrJoinLobby(secret, [](discordpp::ClientResult result, uint64_t
             lobbyId) {
                 // Successfully joined lobby!
             });
         }
     });
 });
 [/codeblock]


 [b]### Join Requests Code Example[/b]
 Users can also request to join each others parties. This code snippet shows how that flow might look:

 [color=orange]WARNING:[/color] The following example is in C++.
 [codeblock lang=text]
 // User A
 // 1. Create a lobby with secret
 std::string lobbySecret = "foo";
 client-&gt;CreateOrJoinLobby(lobbySecret, [=](discordpp::ClientResult result, uint64_t lobbyId) {
     // 2. Update rich presence with join secret
     discordpp::Activity activity{};
     // set name, state, party size ...
     discordpp::ActivitySecrets secrets{};
     secrets.SetJoin(lobbySecret);
     activity.SetSecrets(secrets);
     client-&gt;UpdateRichPresence(std::move(activity), [](discordpp::ClientResult result) {});
 });


 // User B
 // 3. Request to join User A's party
 client-&gt;SendActivityJoinRequest(USER_A_ID, [](auto result) {});


 // User A
 // Monitor for new invites:
 client-&gt;SetActivityInviteCreatedCallback([client](auto invite) {
     // 5. The game can now show that User A has received a request to join their party
     // If User A is ok with that, they can reply back:
     // Note: invite.type will be ActivityActionTypes::JoinRequest in this example
     client-&gt;SendActivityJoinRequestReply(invite, [](auto result) {});
 });


 // User B
 // 6. Same as before, user B can monitor for invites
 client-&gt;SetActivityInviteCreatedCallback([client](auto invite) {
     // 7. When an invite is received, ask the user if they want to accept it.
     // If they choose to do so then go ahead and invoke AcceptActivityInvite
     client-&gt;AcceptActivityInvite(invite,
         [client](discordpp::ClientResult result, std::string secret) {
         if (result.Successful()) {
             // 5. Join the lobby using the joinSecret
             client-&gt;CreateOrJoinLobby(secret, [](auto result, uint64_t lobbyId) {
                 // Successfully joined lobby!
             });
         }
     });
 });
 [/codeblock]
