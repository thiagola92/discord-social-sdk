	<brief_description>
	This enum refers to the status of the internal websocket the SDK uses to communicate with Discord There are ~2 phases for "launching" the client:
</brief_description>
	<description>
	- The socket has to connect to Discord and exchange an auth token. This is indicated by the [code]Connecting[/code] and [code]Connected[/code] values.
- The socket has to receive an initial payload of data that describes the current user, what lobbies they are in, who their friends are, etc. This is the [code]Ready[/code] status. Many [DiscordClient] functions will not work until the status changes to [code]Ready[/code], such as [TODO:].
[TODO:] is the one you want to wait for!
Additionally, sometimes the socket will be disconnected, such as through temporary network blips. But it will try to automatically reconnect, as indicated by the [code]Reconnecting[/code] status.
