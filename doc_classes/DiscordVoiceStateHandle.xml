	<brief_description>
	A [DiscordVoiceStateHandle] represents the state of a single participant in a Discord voice call.</brief_description>
	<description>
	The main use case for [DiscordVoiceStateHandle] in the SDK is communicate whether a user has muted or defeaned themselves.
Handle objects in the SDK hold a reference both to the underlying data, and to the SDK instance. Changes to the underlying data will generally be available on existing handles objects without having to re-create them. If the SDK instance is destroyed, but you still have a reference to a handle object, note that it will return the default value for all method calls (ie an empty string for methods that return a string).</description>
