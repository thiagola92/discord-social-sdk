	<brief_description>&lt;para&gt;A &lt;ref refid="classdiscordpp_1_1VoiceStateHandle" kindref="compound"&gt;VoiceStateHandle&lt;/ref&gt; represents the state of a single participant in a Discord voice call. &lt;/para&gt;</brief_description>
	<description>&lt;para&gt;The main use case for &lt;ref refid="classdiscordpp_1_1VoiceStateHandle" kindref="compound"&gt;VoiceStateHandle&lt;/ref&gt; in the SDK is communicate whether a user has muted or defeaned themselves.&lt;/para&gt;
&lt;para&gt;Handle objects in the SDK hold a reference both to the underlying data, and to the SDK instance. Changes to the underlying data will generally be available on existing handles objects without having to re-create them. If the SDK instance is destroyed, but you still have a reference to a handle object, note that it will return the default value for all method calls (ie an empty string for methods that return a string). &lt;/para&gt;</description>
